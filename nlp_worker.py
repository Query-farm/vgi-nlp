"""VGI worker exposing classical NLP (spaCy + fastText + VADER) to DuckDB/SQL.

Assembles the scalar and table-in-out functions in ``vgi_nlp`` into a single
``nlp`` catalog and runs the worker over stdio (local) or HTTP (via serve.py).

Usage:
    uv run nlp_worker.py                 # serve over stdio (DuckDB subprocess)
    python serve.py --port 8000          # serve over HTTP

    INSTALL vgi FROM community; LOAD vgi;
    ATTACH 'nlp' (TYPE vgi, LOCATION 'uv run nlp_worker.py');

    SELECT nlp.detect_lang(review) AS lang, count(*) FROM reviews GROUP BY 1;
    SELECT * FROM nlp.entities((SELECT id, body FROM articles), id := 'id');
    SELECT id, nlp.sentiment(body) AS score FROM reviews;

First-use model requirements:
    uv run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    curl -L -o ~/.cache/vgi-nlp/lid.176.ftz \
        https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/supervised-models/lid.176.ftz
